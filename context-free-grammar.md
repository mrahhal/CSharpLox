## Expressions - First Attempt

```cfg
expression → literal
           | unary
           | binary
           | grouping ;

literal    → NUMBER | STRING | "true" | "false" | "nil" ;
grouping   → "(" expression ")" ;
unary      → ( "-" | "!" ) expression ;
binary     → expression operator expression ;
operator   → "==" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">="
           | "+"  | "-"  | "*" | "/" ;
```

## Current

```cfg
program        → declaration* eof ;

declaration    → varDecl
               | statement ;

varDecl        → "var" IDENTIFIER ( "=" expression )? ";" ;

statement      → exprStmt
               | forStmt
               | ifStmt
               | printStmt
               | whileStmt
               | block ;

forStmt        → "for" "(" ( varDecl | exprStmt | ";" )
                           expression? ";"
                           expression? ")" statement ;

whileStmt      → "while" "(" expression ")" statement ;

ifStmt         → "if" "(" expression ")" statement ( "else" statement )? ;

block          → "{" declaration* "}" ;

exprStmt       → expression ";" ;
printStmt      → "print" expression ";" ;

expression     → assignment ;
assignment     → identifier "=" assignment
               | logic_or ;
logic_or       → logic_and ( "or" logic_and )* ;
logic_and      → equality ( "and" equality )* ;
equality       → comparison ( ( "!=" | "==" ) comparison )* ;
comparison     → addition ( ( ">" | ">=" | "<" | "<=" ) addition )* ;
addition       → multiplication ( ( "-" | "+" ) multiplication )* ;
multiplication → unary ( ( "/" | "*" ) unary )* ;
unary          → ( "!" | "-" ) unary
               | primary ;
primary        → "true" | "false" | "nil" | "this"
               | NUMBER | STRING
               | "(" expression ")"
               | IDENTIFIER ;
```
